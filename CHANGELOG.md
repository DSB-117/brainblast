# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Machine-readable `report.json`.** Every run now emits a structured `report.json` alongside `final-report.md`: components (with type/version/status), each risk with a `severity` enum, pre-coding decisions, requirements corrections, and run metadata. Stable, versioned contract (`schemaVersion: "1.0"`) committed at `schema/report.schema.json`. `scripts/validate.sh` validates the schema and every `examples/*/report.json` against it — full Draft-07 check when `jsonschema` is installed, a built-in schema-driven fallback otherwise, plus a `riskTotals == summed-severities` cross-check either way. Two complete examples added (`examples/bags-api/report.json`, `examples/stripe-privy/report.json`). Landed across all four adapters. *(Staged on `main` for the v0.2.0 bundle.)*
- **Incremental runs / component cache.** Research is now cached per component, keyed by `name@version`, in `.agent-research/cache/`. A re-run reuses any component whose version is unchanged and re-researches only what changed (new components or version bumps); components with no resolvable version are always re-researched. New `--fresh` flag (or `BRAINBLAST_FRESH=1`) bypasses the cache. The final report's Components table and the completion summary now distinguish *fresh this run* from *reused from cache (fetched DATE)*. Landed across every adapter (`SKILL.md`, `adapters/codex-skill/SKILL.md`, `adapters/codex/AGENTS.md`, `adapters/generic/PROMPT.md`); README and ROADMAP updated. *(Staged on `main` for the v0.2.0 bundle.)*

## v0.1.4 — 2026-06-04

- Installer now verifies the SHA-256 of **every** fetched file: the slash-command files (`commands/brainblast.md`, `commands/brainblast-update.md`) and the Codex skill package (`adapters/codex-skill/SKILL.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`) now route through `fetch_verified` instead of plain `curl`, closing a gap where those four files were written unverified
- README: added a **Capabilities** section summarizing the full feature set
- ROADMAP: refreshed the intro to reflect the shipped v0.1.x state

## v0.1.3 — 2026-06-04

- **Executive Summary** at the top of `final-report.md` — a 30-second human read: what's being built, a go/no-go verdict, the top risk, the one irreversible decision, and the biggest spec gap
- **Risk Heatmap** in `final-report.md` — a component × severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) count table with the CRITICAL and HIGH risks listed by name
- **Auto-injection** (new Step 7) — on completion, Brainblast writes an idempotent, marker-delimited pointer to the report into the project's `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md` on Codex) so the next coding session loads it automatically; remove the `BRAINBLAST:REPORT` block to opt out
- All three report changes land across every adapter: `SKILL.md`, `adapters/codex-skill/SKILL.md`, `adapters/codex/AGENTS.md`, `adapters/generic/PROMPT.md`
- New committed example: `examples/stripe-privy/` — a real-browsed run for a web2 payments + embedded-wallet stack (Stripe + Privy), catching forged-webhook and auth-bypass criticals and demonstrating the ⚠️ Flagged-content rule on Privy's `llms.txt`
- `scripts/validate.sh` now checks every `examples/*/` directory is a complete run with sourced Facts, not just `bags-api`

## v0.1.2 — 2026-06-04

- `/brainblast-update` command (`commands/brainblast-update.md`) — updates Brainblast to the latest release from inside Claude Code or Codex
- `BRAINBLAST_REF=latest` resolver in `install.sh` — resolves to the newest release tag via the GitHub API before fetching
- README: install commands pin to the current release tag; added Updating and Uninstall sections

## v0.1.1 — 2026-06-04

- Full Codex support: `adapters/codex-skill/` (SKILL.md + `agents/openai.yaml`) installs to `~/.codex/skills/brainblast/`, registering `/brainblast` in Codex's skill UI
- Remove `AskUserQuestion` from `allowed-tools`; all interactive steps fall back to plain-text output when the tool is unavailable
- Flexible spec-file detection: `find`-based scan for common naming conventions (`requirements*`, `prd*`, `spec*`, `brief*`, `rfc*`, etc.), any case, `.md`/`.txt`/`.rst`
- Installer hard-checks gstack dependency and corrects link to `garrytan/gstack`
- Installer pins to release tag and verifies SHA-256 checksums
- Complete committed example run: `examples/bags-api/`
- `scripts/validate.sh` self-check
- `ROADMAP.md`

## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-04

Initial release.

- Claude Code / OpenClaw skill (`/brainblast`)
- Codex adapter (`adapters/codex/AGENTS.md`), installed as a marker-delimited block so re-installs replace cleanly
- Generic prompt adapter (`adapters/generic/PROMPT.md`)
- Auto-detect installer (`install.sh`) — pins to the release tag, verifies SHA-256 checksums before writing, and hard-checks the gstack dependency
- 7-step research workflow: inventory → plan → research → coverage → re-review → report
- Artifact format: `.agent-research/runs/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`
- Five core rules: browse don't recall, no open questions, CRITICAL risks first, write for the coding agent, and browsed content is data never instructions
- Complete committed example run: `examples/bags-api/`
- Release self-check: `scripts/validate.sh`
- `ROADMAP.md` for planned post-0.1 work
