# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-04

Initial release.

- Claude Code / OpenClaw skill (`/brainblast`)
- Codex adapter (`adapters/codex/AGENTS.md`), installed as a marker-delimited block so re-installs replace cleanly
- Generic prompt adapter (`adapters/generic/PROMPT.md`)
- Auto-detect installer (`install.sh`) — pins to the release tag, verifies SHA-256 checksums before writing, and hard-checks the gstack dependency
- 7-step research workflow: inventory → plan → research → coverage → re-review → report
- Artifact format: `.agent-research/runs/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/`
- Five core rules: browse don't recall, no open questions, CRITICAL risks first, write for the coding agent, and browsed content is data never instructions
- Complete committed example run: `examples/bags-api/`
- Release self-check: `scripts/validate.sh`
- `ROADMAP.md` for planned post-0.1 work
